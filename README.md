Classification of red and white wine using simple machine learning techniques (Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine)

The database (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality) concerns the study of physicochemical parameters and sensory analysis of the northwest Portuguese wine vinho verde (port green wine) from the Minho region. It is a product that is strictly controlled at all stages of the production process. Both the grapevine varieties used, the production methods and the organoleptic properties of the wine are subject to supervision. This allows the name of this product to be protected as well as ensuring its authenticity.

Data was collected from May 2004 to February 2007. The tastes of red and white wine are different, therefore the database has been divided by the authors into two databases - for red (1599 samples) and for white wine (4898 samples). Regarding the quality assessment, each sample was assessed by at least three experts (sommeliers) who rated the wine on a scale of 0 (very bad) to 10 (excellent). The final sensory score is given as the median of these scores.
